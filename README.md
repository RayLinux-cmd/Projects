# Academic Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my comprehensive collection of academic projects developed throughout my educational journey. This repository serves as a centralized showcase of complex software engineering, data science, and computational projects completed during my studies.

## Repository Structure

This repository follows a **branch-based organization** where each significant project resides in its own dedicated branch. The main branch serves as a landing page and project directory, while individual branches contain the complete source code, documentation, and resources for each project.

### Navigation
- **Main Branch**: Project overview and navigation hub
- **Project Branches**: Individual branches containing complete project implementations
- **Documentation**: Each project branch includes comprehensive documentation and setup instructions

## Current Projects

### Language & Compiler Development
**JavaScript Compiler** *(Python)*
- Custom compiler implementation translating JavaScript to executable code
- Demonstrates deep understanding of language parsing, lexical analysis, and code generation
- Built using Python with comprehensive error handling and optimization techniques

### Systems Programming & Security
**Rust Attack Simulator**
- Advanced cybersecurity simulation tool for penetration testing scenarios
- Implements various attack vectors and defensive mechanisms
- Showcases Rust's memory safety and performance capabilities

**Rust System Monitor**
- Real-time system performance monitoring application
- Tracks CPU, memory, disk, and network usage with efficient resource management
- Demonstrates systems programming expertise and concurrent processing

### Application Development
**C++ Wardrobe Manager**
- Sophisticated inventory management system for clothing and accessories
- Features advanced data structures, file I/O, and user interface design
- Implements object-oriented programming principles and memory management

## Featured Technologies
